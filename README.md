# meme-generator-python
A simple Python script that generates meme.

###Requirements:
* Python 2.
* [Wand](http://docs.wand-py.org/en/0.4.4/). Wand is a Python binding of [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/). I somehow find it more convenient than Pillow. You can install Wand with pip using the following command - ```pip install wand```.

###Some usage examples:
* ```python memegen.py "Here's to all the memes" "That make us smile" photo.jpg```
* ```python memegen.py "" "One doesn't simply make a meme without a script." photo.png```
* ```python memegen.py "This is why I love this guy" "" photo.jpg```

Meme(s) made with memegen:

The code is so simple! Feel free to contribute to it. ^_^
